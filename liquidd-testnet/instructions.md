# Bitcoin Core

Bitcoin Core begins its Initial Block Download (IBD) — fetching and verifying the entire chain — the moment it launches; nothing needs configuring first. This page covers what's specific to running it on StartOS.

## Documentation

- [Start9 Bitcoin Guides](https://docs.start9.com/bitcoin-guides/) — running and syncing Bitcoin Core on StartOS, pruning, and connecting wallets and other services to it.

## What you get on StartOS

- **A full Bitcoin node** — downloads, verifies, and relays the entire blockchain, then stays in sync.
- **A JSON-RPC interface on port 8332** that other StartOS services (Lightning nodes, Electrum servers, mempool explorers) and external apps connect to.
- **ZeroMQ block and transaction notifications** for services that subscribe to them.
- **Privacy networking out of the box** — outbound peer connections go over Tor, and a bundled I2P daemon accepts inbound I2P connections, with no setup required.
- **Disk-aware sizing** — on disks under roughly 900 GB the node prunes automatically (and leaves `txindex` off) to fit; on larger disks it runs as a full archival node. Either way it still behaves like a full node to anything using its RPC — see **Pruned nodes** below. Initial sync also runs with a temporarily larger database cache that reverts to the upstream default once it completes.
- **Configuration through StartOS actions** instead of hand-editing `bitcoin.conf`.

## Getting set up

There is no setup wizard and nothing required to start using Bitcoin Core — it begins syncing on first launch.

1. Open Bitcoin Core's **Dashboard** tab to watch sync progress. A full Initial Block Download takes anywhere from several hours to a few days depending on your hardware, disk, and network.
2. To use a service that depends on Bitcoin Core — a Lightning node, an Electrum server, a block explorer — just install it; it configures its connection to Bitcoin Core automatically. It will report that it's waiting for Bitcoin to sync until IBD finishes.
3. To connect an external wallet or app, follow instructions in the Start9 Bitcoin guides (linked above).

## Using Bitcoin Core

Bitcoin Core surfaces its interfaces — RPC, peer, ZeroMQ, and the I2P console when you've enabled it — on the **Dashboard** tab; everything else is driven by actions in the service's sidebar.

### RPC access

The JSON-RPC API listens on port 8332. Dependent StartOS services connect and configure themselves automatically when you install them — you set nothing up. For an external wallet or app, run **Generate RPC User Credentials** to mint a username and password, then point the app at port 8332. **Delete RPC Users** removes credentials you've created. `rpcuser`/`rpcpassword` lines in `bitcoin.conf` are not supported and are stripped; authentication is the `.cookie` file or `rpcauth` users.

### Pruned nodes

On a small disk Bitcoin Core runs **pruned** — it keeps validating every block but discards old block files once they're checked, so on-disk usage stays around a few hundred MB of recent blocks instead of the full multi-hundred-GB chain. Pruning is on by default below roughly 900 GB of disk; you can also toggle it under **Other Settings**.

So that a pruned node is still useful to wallets and services that occasionally need an old block, a bundled proxy — `btc-rpc-proxy` — runs in front of it on port 8332. When something requests a block the node has pruned, the proxy fetches that block from the peer-to-peer network on the spot and serves it back over the normal RPC. To anything using the RPC — a Lightning node rescanning, an Electrum server, a block explorer — the node looks like a full archival node and works with no special configuration. The only cost is a little latency the first time a given historical block is requested.

### Configuration

Four actions write to `bitcoin.conf` for you. Only values that differ from upstream defaults are stored, and each field shows its upstream default.

- **Mempool Settings** — mempool size and expiry, persistence, bare-multisig and `OP_RETURN` relay policy, blocks-only mode.
- **Peer Settings** — which networks to use (`onlynet`: IPv4/IPv6/Tor/I2P/CJDNS), BIP324 v2 transport, the embedded I2P SAM proxy, and manual `addnode`/`connect` peers.
- **RPC Settings** — RPC server timeout, thread count, and work-queue depth.
- **Other Settings** — ZeroMQ, `txindex`, coinstats index, BIP158/BIP157 block filters, bloom filters, wallet options, pruning, and database cache tuning.

Some options are fixed by the package and not exposed: RPC cookie authentication, the peer listen ports, `assumevalid`, and the Tor proxy. Advanced i2pd-daemon tuning isn't in the UI either — edit `i2pd.conf` on the `i2pd` volume if you need it.

### Maintenance

- **Reindex Blockchain** — rebuild blocks and chainstate from scratch (use after on-disk corruption).
- **Reindex Chainstate** — rebuild just the chainstate from existing blocks (hidden on pruned nodes).
- **Delete Peer List** / **Delete Transaction Index** / **Delete Coinstats Index** — remove a corrupted `peers.dat`, `txindex`, or `coinstatsindex`. The service must be stopped to run these.

### Other actions

- **Download UTXO Snapshot (assumeutxo)** — fast-sync from a recent UTXO snapshot; available while running, hidden once fully synced.
- **Runtime Information** — connection count, block height, sync progress, soft-fork status, and (when enabled) the IPC socket path.
- **Enable IPC** — toggle Bitcoin Core's experimental multiprocess IPC socket. Toggling switches the running binary and the action restarts Bitcoin Core to apply the change; leave it off unless an integration you're using calls for it.

## Limitations

- **Blockchain data is not backed up.** Backups cover `bitcoin.conf`, `store.json`, wallets, and `peers.dat` — block and chainstate data re-sync after a restore.
- **Shutdown can take up to 5 minutes** while the database flushes; let it finish rather than force-stopping.
- **IPC is experimental** — toggling it restarts Bitcoin Core, and it's intended for advanced integrations.
- **Some i2pd tuning isn't in the UI** (log level, bandwidth class, transit limits, web console) — edit `i2pd.conf` directly if you need to change those.
